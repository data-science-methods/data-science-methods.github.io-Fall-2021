      <title>Lab due dates</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few questions about when the labs are due, and realized I forgot to make this explicit. Sorry about that!
There are no particular due dates for the labs. They have different lengths and levels of difficulty, and some of you will be working in pairs (hopefully everyone!) while others are working individually. And the amount of time you have to work on the lab might change from week to week.</description>

      <title>First day of class</title>

      <description>As part of the fallout from the Merced Station housing crisis, campus has delayed synchronous class meetings until August 30. For our class, this means we&amp;rsquo;re missing the first day.
We&amp;rsquo;ll try to make up for this lost meeting by moving a little faster than planned through the first few weeks.
Please be ready to hit the ground running when we meet for the first time next Tuesday, August 31:</description>
