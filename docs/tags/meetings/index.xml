      <description>As part of the fallout from the Merced Station housing crisis, campus has delayed synchronous class meetings until August 30. For our class, this means we&amp;rsquo;re missing the first day.
We&amp;rsquo;ll try to make up for this lost meeting by moving a little faster than planned through the first few weeks.
Please be ready to hit the ground running when we meet for the first time next Tuesday, August 31:</description>
