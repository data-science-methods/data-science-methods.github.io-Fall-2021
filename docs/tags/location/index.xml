      <description>Two things for next week.
  Class on Tuesday will be in SSM 317. This is the conference room in the middle of the floor, in the upper half of the mini-building. I’ll send out another reminder on Monday.
  Between Tuesday and Thursday, I’m going to ask you to find 5 papers in your field and examine the Data sections (or the data part of the Methods section or whatever they do) in light the discussion we’re going to have on Tuesday.</description>
