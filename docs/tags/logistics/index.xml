      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a few questions about when the labs are due, and realized I forgot to make this explicit. Sorry about that!
There are no particular due dates for the labs. They have different lengths and levels of difficulty, and some of you will be working in pairs (hopefully everyone!) while others are working individually. And the amount of time you have to work on the lab might change from week to week.</description>
