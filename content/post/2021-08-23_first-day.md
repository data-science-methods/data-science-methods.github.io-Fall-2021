As part of the fallout from the [Merced Station housing crisis](https://news.ucmerced.edu/content/housing-and-fall-semester-update), campus has [delayed synchronous class meetings until August 30](https://doyourpart.ucmerced.edu/node/4301).  For our class, this means we're missing the first day.  

We'll try to make up for this lost meeting by moving a little faster than planned through the first few weeks.  

Please be ready to hit the ground running when we meet for the first time next Tuesday, August 31:  

- Take a look at the [course website](https://data-science-methods.github.io/) and [lecture notes](https://data-science-methods.github.io/book/)
    - Especially the [Introduction](https://data-science-methods.github.io/book/introduction.html) and [Software, hardware, and accounts](https://data-science-methods.github.io/book/software-hardware-and-accounts.html) sections of the notes
- [Watch this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwRdO9_GGhY) and [take a look at this paper](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005510), and prepare to discuss them
