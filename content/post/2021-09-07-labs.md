I've had a few questions about when the labs are due, and realized I forgot to make this explicit.  Sorry about that!  

There are no particular due dates for the labs.  They have different lengths and levels of difficulty, and some of you will be working in pairs (hopefully everyone!) while others are working individually.  And the amount of time you have to work on the lab might change from week to week.  

Instead of fixed due dates, the lab workflow I have in mind goes like this:  

- you (and your partner) work through the lab until your code passes all of the tests and you're satisfied with your written answers
- you submit a PR
- I review your code and give you feedback
- you revise and update the PR
- once we're all satisfied I'll close the PR
