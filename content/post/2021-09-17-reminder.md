Two things for next week.  

1. Class on Tuesday will be in SSM 317.  This is the conference room in the middle of the floor, in the upper half of the mini-building.  I’ll send out another reminder on Monday.  

2. Between Tuesday and Thursday, I’m going to ask you to find 5 papers in your field and examine the Data sections (or the data part of the Methods section or whatever they do) in light the discussion we’re going to have on Tuesday.  Then in class on Thursday we’ll be thinking about how to enrich or expand Data sections to include the kinds of things Leonelli discusses.  

I’m telling you about this now so that you have the weekend to find the 5 papers.  There aren't any strict guidelines for selecting these papers, but it would probably be useful to look at papers in different journals and that use different methods.
